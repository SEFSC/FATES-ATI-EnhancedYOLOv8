For installing dependencies, pip install ultralytics

For demo training purpose, small dataset consisting around 1000 fish images and labels is provided inside directory : datasets/Small_Train_GFISHERD24

To train in this small dataset for demo purpose following script can be used:
python trainYOLOv8_demo.py

Different paths can be given, inside ...dataset_name_.yaml to work with full datasets SEAMAPD21 or GFISHERSD24.
